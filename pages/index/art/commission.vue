    <p>
      Thank you for your interest. To commission me, you should follow everything that mentioned below.
      <b>If you don't want to read all stuffs, I have mark text bold for you.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Fill this form and send to me when you commission:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Character name: (Name of your OC or furry.)</li>
      <li>Reference/Images: (A reference sheet or several images of your character.)</li>
      <li>Description: (Description of your character such as pose, expression.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I accept all safe and suggestive art commissions,
      <b>No NSFW and fetish arts.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      To commission,
      <b>the reference to your characters must be included in your message. Any images of your character are fine.</b> You cannot just say "I want my OC drawn" because I cannot read your mind. Other details like poses and expression are also recommended to be included.
    </p>

    <p>
      You need to pay via
      <b>Paypal or DeviantArt points</b>. The price listed below is based on a solo, full-body picture of a character. It's for reference only.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Contact me via DeviantArt Note, Twitter DM or Facebook Message</b> about your commission. Once I accepted your commission we can talk about details from other social media if you think it's more convenient.
    </p>

    <p>
      The art can
      <b>take two weeks to one month</b> to finish since I have a project to do. If you want it to be done in a certain time, we can discuss.
    </p>

    <p>If you don't want your commissioned artwork to be public please let me know in the note. Your name will be hidden and replaced with (Anon XXXXXX) in my to-do list. XXXXXX is 6-alphanumeric code I will give you once I received the payment.</p>

    <p>List of creatures I recommend:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pony</li>
      <li>Pony in anthro form</li>
      <li>Eeveelutions (Pokemon)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I cannot guarantee the quality of drawing other creatures, and price may be very different from the list. If you needed other creatures to be drawn, details can be discussed.</p>

    <p>
      <b>For Point Commissions, please check my commission widget on my page.</b> Without any specific points on the list, the convert rate at
